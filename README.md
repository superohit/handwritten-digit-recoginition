# Handwritten-Digit-Recoginition
In this project we use sklearn Dataset of 64 attributes and 1797 instances of image 8x8 and predict the dataset using sklearn library and used Support Vector Machine and Random Forest Classifier to predict the result.
As we use Support Vector Machine that gives us atleast 100% accuracy and Random Forest classifier gives 93% accuracy.
